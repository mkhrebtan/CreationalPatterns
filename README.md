# Climate Modeling System

A comprehensive .NET 9 console application demonstrating creational design patterns through a climate data modeling and simulation system. This project showcases the **Builder Pattern** and **Prototype Pattern** in action.

## 🌍 Overview

The Climate Modeling System provides a flexible framework for creating, configuring, and comparing different climate models across various geographical regions. The system supports Arctic, Desert, and Temperate climate types with customizable parameters including temperature, pressure, ocean levels, and ice coverage.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multiple Climate Types**: Support for Cold (Arctic), Hot (Desert), and Moderate (Temperate) climate models
- **Builder Pattern Implementation**: Step-by-step construction of complex climate models with fluent interface
- **Prototype Pattern Integration**: Clone and customize existing climate models efficiently
- **Climate Comparison**: Detailed comparison between different climate models
- **Flexible Configuration**: Create custom climate models with specific parameters
- **Comprehensive Data Output**: Detailed climate data representation and analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Builder Pattern**
   - `ClimateModelBuilder` (Abstract Builder)
   - `ColdClimateModelBuilder`, `HotClimateModelBuilder`, `ModerateClimateModelBuilder` (Concrete Builders)
   - `ClimateModelClient` (Director)
   - `ClimateModel` (Product)

2. **Prototype Pattern**
   - `IClimateModel` (Prototype Interface)
   - `ClimateModel` (Concrete Prototype with Clone method)
